The iOS player app should be straightforward to use.

- To **play** music, just tap the PLAY (triangle) button on the right.
  Restarting the app will also start the player.
- To **pause** music, just tap the pause button on the left.

Note that the app requires an Internet connection.


If you run into any issues with the app please feel free to 
[open an issue](https://github.com/artxfm/iosplayer/issues) 
in github or write to info@artxfm.com.
